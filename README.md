`pip-audit` is a tool for scanning Python environments for packages
with known vulnerabilities. It uses the Python Packaging Advisory Database
(https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database) via the
[PyPI JSON API](https://warehouse.pypa.io/api-reference/json.html) as a source
of vulnerability reports.

This project is maintained in part by [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/)
with support from Google. This is not an official Google or Trail of Bits product.

### GitHub Actions

`pip-audit` has [an official GitHub Action](https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pip-audit)!

You can install it from the
[GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gh-action-pip-audit), or
add it to your CI manually:

```yaml
jobs:
  pip-audit:
    steps:
      - uses: pypa/gh-action-pip-audit@v1.0.0
        with:
          inputs: requirements.txt

```yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/pypa/pip-audit
    rev: v2.4.5
    hooks:
      -   id: pip-audit
          args: ["-r", "requirements.txt"]

ci:
  # Leave pip-audit to only run locally and not in CI
  # pre-commit.ci does not allow network calls
  skip: [pip-audit]
```

                 [project_path]

audit the Python environment for dependencies with known vulnerabilities

positional arguments:
  project_path          audit a local Python project at the given path
                        (default: None)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -l, --local           show only results for dependencies in the local
                        environment (default: False)
  -r REQUIREMENT, --requirement REQUIREMENT
                        audit the given requirements file; this option can be
                        used multiple times (default: None)
  -f FORMAT, --format FORMAT
                        the format to emit audit results in (choices: columns,
                        json, cyclonedx-json, cyclonedx-xml, markdown)
                        (default: columns)
  -s SERVICE, --vulnerability-service SERVICE
                        the vulnerability service to audit dependencies
                        against (choices: osv, pypi) (default: pypi)
  -d, --dry-run         without `--fix`: collect all dependencies but do not
                        perform the auditing step; with `--fix`: perform the
                        auditing step but do not perform any fixes (default:
                        False)
  -S, --strict          fail the entire audit if dependency collection fails
                        on any dependency (default: False)
  --desc [{on,off,auto}]
                        include a description for each vulnerability; `auto`
                        defaults to `on` for the `json` format. This flag has
                        no effect on the `cyclonedx-json` or `cyclonedx-xml`
                        formats. (default: auto)
  --cache-dir CACHE_DIR
                        the directory to use as an HTTP cache for PyPI; uses
                        the `pip` HTTP cache by default (default: None)
  --progress-spinner {on,off}
                        display a progress spinner (default: on)

  --path PATH           restrict to the specified installation path for
                        auditing packages; this option can be used multiple
                        times (default: [])
  -v, --verbose         give more output; this setting overrides the
                        `PIP_AUDIT_LOGLEVEL` variable and is equivalent to
                        setting it to `debug` (default: False)
  --fix                 automatically upgrade dependencies with known
                        vulnerabilities (default: False)
  --require-hashes      require a hash to check each requirement against, for
                        repeatable audits; this option is implied when any
                        package in a requirements file has a `--hash` option.
                        (default: False)
  --index-url INDEX_URL
                        base URL of the Python Package Index; this should
                        point to a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the
                        simple repository API) (default:
                        https://pypi.org/simple)
  --extra-index-url URL
                        extra URLs of package indexes to use in addition to
                        `--index-url`; should follow the same rules as
                        `--index-url` (default: [])
  --skip-editable       don't audit packages that are marked as editable
                        (default: False)
  --no-deps             don't perform any dependency resolution; requires all
                        requirements are pinned to an exact version (default:
                        False)
  -o FILE, --output FILE
                        output results to the given file (default: None)
  --ignore-vuln ID      ignore a specific vulnerability by its vulnerability
                        ID (default: [])
```

### Exit codes

On completion, `pip-audit` will exit with a code indicating its status.

The current codes are:

* `0`: No known vulnerabilities were detected.
* `1`: One or more known vulnerabilities were found.

### Dry runs

`pip-audit` supports the `--dry-run` flag, which can be used to control whether
an audit (or fix) step is actually performed.

* On its own, `pip-audit --dry-run` skips the auditing step and prints
  the number of dependencies that *would have been* audited.
* In fix mode, `pip-audit --fix --dry-run` performs the auditing step and prints
  out the fix behavior (i.e., which dependencies would be upgraded or skipped)
  that *would have been performed*.

## Examples

Audit dependencies for the current Python environment:
```
$ pip-audit
No known vulnerabilities found
```

Audit dependencies for a given requirements file:
```
$ pip-audit -r ./requirements.txt
No known vulnerabilities found
```

Audit dependencies for a requirements file, excluding system packages:
```
$ pip-audit -r ./requirements.txt -l
No known vulnerabilities found
```

Audit dependencies for a local Python project:
```
$ pip-audit .
No known vulnerabilities found
```
`pip-audit` searches the provided path for various Python "project" files. At the moment, only `pyproject.toml` is supported.

Audit dependencies when there are vulnerabilities present:
```

## Troubleshooting

Have you resolved a problem with `pip-audit`? Help us by contributing to this
section!

### `pip-audit` shows irrelevant vulnerability reports!

In a perfect world, vulnerability feeds would have an infinite signal-to-noise
ratio: every vulnerability report would be (1) correct, and (2) applicable to
every use of every dependency.

Unfortunately, neither of these is guaranteed: vulnerability feeds are not
immune to extraneous or spam reports, and not all uses of a particular
dependency map to all potential classes of vulnerabilities.

If your `pip-audit` runs produce vulnerability reports that aren't actionable
for your particular application or use case, you can use the `--ignore-vuln ID`
option to ignore specific vulnerability reports. `--ignore-vuln` supports
aliases, so you can use a `GHSA-xxx` or `CVE-xxx` ID instead of a `PYSEC-xxx`
ID if the report in question does not have a PYSEC ID.

For example, here is how you might ignore GHSA-w596-4wvx-j9j6, which is a
common source of noisy vulnerability reports and false positives for users of
[`pytest`](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest):

```console
# Run the audit as normal, but exclude any reports that match GHSA-w596-4wvx-j9j6
$ pip-audit --ignore-vuln GHSA-w596-4wvx-j9j6
```

The `--ignore-vuln ID` option works with all other dependency resolution
and auditing options, meaning that it should function correctly with
requirements-style inputs, alternative vulnerability feeds, and so forth.

### `pip-audit` takes longer than I expect!

Depending on how you're using it, `pip-audit` may have to perform its
own dependency resolution, which can take roughly as long as `pip install`
does for a project. See the [security model](#security-model) for an explanation.

You have two options for avoiding dependency resolution: *audit a pre-installed
environment*, or *ensure that your dependencies are already fully resolved*.

If you know that you've already fully configured an environment equivalent
to the one that `pip-audit -r requirements.txt` would audit, you can simply
reuse it:

```console
# Note the absence of any "input" arguments, indicating that the environment is used.
$ pip-audit

# Optionally filter out non-local packages, for virtual environments:
$ pip-audit --local
```

Alternatively, if your input is fully pinned (and optionally hashed), you
can tell `pip-audit` to skip dependency resolution with either `--no-deps`
(pinned without hashes) or `--require-hashes` (pinned including hashes).

The latter is equivalent to `pip`'s
[hash-checking mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#hash-checking-mode)
and is preferred, since it offers additional integrity.

```console
# fails if any dependency is not fully pinned
$ pip-audit --no-deps -r requirements.txt

# fails if any dependency is not fully pinned *or* is missing hashes
$ pip-audit --require-hashes -r requirements.txt
```

## Tips and Tricks

### Running against a `pipenv` project

`pipenv` uses both a `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` file to track and freeze dependencies
instead of a `requirements.txt` file. `pip-audit` cannot process the `Pipfile[.lock]`
files directly, however, these can be converted to a supported `requirements.txt` file
that `pip-audit` can run against. Use a Python tool, such as
[`pipfile-requirements`](https://github.com/frostming/pipfile-requirements), to
convert your `Pipfile[.lock]` to a `requirements.txt` file and then run
`pip-audit` against the generated requirements file.

```console
$ pipenv install --dev pipfile-requirements
$ pipenv run pipfile2req Pipfile.lock > requirements.txt
$ pipenv run pip-audit -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file needs to be kept up to date with `pipenv` when running
`pip-audit` locally like this.

## Security Model

This section exists to describe the security assumptions you **can** and **must not**
make when using `pip-audit`.

TL;DR: **If you wouldn't `pip install` it, you should not `pip audit` it.**

`pip-audit` is a tool for auditing Python environments for packages with
*known vulnerabilities*. A "known vulnerability" is a publicly reported flaw in
a package that, if uncorrected, *might* allow a malicious actor to perform
unintended actions.

`pip-audit` **can** protect you against known vulnerabilities by telling
you when you have them, and how you should upgrade them. For example,
if you have `somepackage==1.2.3` in your environment, `pip-audit` **can** tell
you that it needs to be upgraded to `1.2.4`.

You **can** assume that `pip-audit` will make a best effort to *fully resolve*
all of your Python dependencies and *either* fully audit each *or* explicitly
state which ones it has skipped, as well as why it has skipped them.

`pip-audit` is **not** a static code analyzer. It analyzes dependency trees,
not code, and it **cannot** guarantee that arbitrary dependency resolutions
occur statically. To understand why this is, refer to Dustin Ingram's
[excellent post on dependency resolution in Python](https://dustingram.com/articles/2018/03/05/why-pypi-doesnt-know-dependencies/).

As such: you **must not** assume that `pip-audit` will **defend** you against
malicious packages. In particular, it is **incorrect** to treat
`pip-audit -r INPUT` as a "more secure" variant of `pip-audit`. For all intents
and purposes, `pip-audit -r INPUT` is functionally equivalent to
`pip install -r INPUT`, with a small amount of **non-security isolation** to
avoid conflicts with any of your local environments.

`pip-audit` is first and foremost a auditing tool for *Python* packages.
You **must not** assume that `pip-audit` will detect or flag "transitive"
vulnerabilities that might be exposed through Python packages, but are not
actually part of the package itself. For example, `pip-audit`'s vulnerability
information sources are unlikely to include an advisory for a vulnerable shared
library that a popular Python package *might* use, since the Python package's
version is not strongly connected to the shared library's version.
