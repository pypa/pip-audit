![CI](https://github.com/trailofbits/pip-audit/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pip-audit.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pip-audit)

`pip-audit` is a prototype tool for scanning Python environments for packages
with known vulnerabilities. It uses the Python Packaging Advisory Database
(https://github.com/pypa/advisory-db) via the
[PyPI JSON API](https://warehouse.pypa.io/api-reference/json.html) as a source
of vulnerability reports.

This project is developed by [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/) with
support from Google. This is not an official Google product.

## Installation

`pip-audit` requires Python 3.6 or newer, and can be installed directly via
`pip`:

```bash
python -m pip install pip-audit
```

## Usage

<!-- @begin-pip-audit-help@ -->
```
usage: pip-audit [-h] [-V] [-l] [-r REQUIREMENTS]
                 [-f {columns,json,cyclonedx-json,cyclonedx-xml}]
                 [-s {osv,pypi}] [-d] [--desc {on,off,auto}]
                 [--cache-dir CACHE_DIR] [--progress-spinner {on,off}]
                 [--timeout TIMEOUT]

audit the Python environment for dependencies with known vulnerabilities

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -l, --local           show only results for dependencies in the local
                        environment (default: False)
  -r REQUIREMENTS, --requirement REQUIREMENTS
                        audit the given requirements file; this option can be
                        used multiple times (default: None)
  -f {columns,json,cyclonedx-json,cyclonedx-xml}, --format {columns,json,cyclonedx-json,cyclonedx-xml}
                        the format to emit audit results in (default: columns)
  -s {osv,pypi}, --vulnerability-service {osv,pypi}
                        the vulnerability service to audit dependencies
                        against (default: pypi)
  -d, --dry-run         collect all dependencies but do not perform the
                        auditing step (default: False)
  --desc {on,off,auto}  include a description for each vulnerability; `auto`
                        defaults to `on` for the `json` format. This flag has
                        no effect on the `cyclonedx-json` or `cyclonedx-xml`
                        formats. (default: auto)
  --cache-dir CACHE_DIR
                        the directory to use as an HTTP cache for PyPI; uses
                        the `pip` HTTP cache by default (default: None)
  --progress-spinner {on,off}
                        display a progress spinner (default: on)
  --timeout TIMEOUT     set the socker timeout (default: 15)

## Examples

Audit dependencies for the current Python environment:
```
$ pip-audit
No known vulnerabilities found
```

Audit dependencies for a given requirements file:
```
$ pip-audit -r ./requirements.txt
No known vulnerabilities found
```

Audit dependencies for the current Python environment excluding system packages:
```
$ pip-audit -r ./requirements.txt -l
No known vulnerabilities found
```

Audit dependencies when there are vulnerabilities present:
```
$ pip-audit
Found 2 known vulnerabilities in 1 packages
Name  Version ID             Fix Versions
----  ------- -------------- ------------
Flask 0.5     PYSEC-2019-179 1.0
Flask 0.5     PYSEC-2018-66  0.12.3
```

Audit dependencies including descriptions:
```
$ pip-audit --desc
Found 2 known vulnerabilities in 1 packages
Name  Version ID             Fix Versions Description
----  ------- -------------- ------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flask 0.5     PYSEC-2019-179 1.0          The Pallets Project Flask before 1.0 is affected by: unexpected memory usage. The impact is: denial of service. The attack vector is: crafted encoded JSON data. The fixed version is: 1. NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2018-1000656.
Flask 0.5     PYSEC-2018-66  0.12.3       The Pallets Project flask version Before 0.12.3 contains a CWE-20: Improper Input Validation vulnerability in flask that can result in Large amount of memory usage possibly leading to denial of service. This attack appear to be exploitable via Attacker provides JSON data in incorrect encoding. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 0.12.3. NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2019-1010083.
