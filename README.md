`pip-audit` is a tool for scanning Python environments for packages
with known vulnerabilities. It uses the Python Packaging Advisory Database
(https://github.com/pypa/advisory-db) via the
[PyPI JSON API](https://warehouse.pypa.io/api-reference/json.html) as a source
of vulnerability reports.

This project is developed by [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/) with
support from Google. This is not an official Google product.

## Features

* Support for auditing local environments and requirements-style files
* Support for multiple vulnerability services
  ([PyPI](https://warehouse.pypa.io/api-reference/json.html#known-vulnerabilities),
  [OSV](https://osv.dev/docs/))
* Support for emitting
  [SBOMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bill_of_materials) in
  [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) XML or JSON
* Human and machine-readable output formats (columnar, JSON)
* Seamlessly reuses your existing local `pip` caches

## Installation

`pip-audit` requires Python 3.7 or newer, and can be installed directly via `pip`:

```bash
python -m pip install pip-audit
```

### Third-party packages

In particular, `pip-audit` can be installed via `conda`:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pip-audit
```

Third-party packages are **not** directly supported by this project. Please consult your package manager's
documentation for more detailed installation guidance.

## Usage

You can run `pip-audit` as a standalone program, or via `python -m`:

```bash
pip-audit --help
python -m pip_audit --help
```

<!-- @begin-pip-audit-help@ -->
```
usage: pip-audit [-h] [-V] [-l] [-r REQUIREMENTS] [-f FORMAT] [-s SERVICE]
                 [-d] [-S] [--desc [{on,off,auto}]] [--cache-dir CACHE_DIR]
                 [--progress-spinner {on,off}] [--timeout TIMEOUT]
                 [--path PATHS] [-v] [--fix] [--require-hashes]
                 [--index-url INDEX_URL] [--extra-index-url EXTRA_INDEX_URLS]

audit the Python environment for dependencies with known vulnerabilities

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -l, --local           show only results for dependencies in the local
                        environment (default: False)
  -r REQUIREMENTS, --requirement REQUIREMENTS
                        audit the given requirements file; this option can be
                        used multiple times (default: None)
  -f FORMAT, --format FORMAT
                        the format to emit audit results in (choices: columns,
                        json, cyclonedx-json, cyclonedx-xml) (default:
                        columns)
  -s SERVICE, --vulnerability-service SERVICE
                        the vulnerability service to audit dependencies
                        against (choices: osv, pypi) (default: pypi)
  -d, --dry-run         without `--fix`: collect all dependencies but do not
                        perform the auditing step; with `--fix`: perform the
                        auditing step but do not perform any fixes (default:
                        False)
  -S, --strict          fail the entire audit if dependency collection fails
                        on any dependency (default: False)
  --desc [{on,off,auto}]
                        include a description for each vulnerability; `auto`
                        defaults to `on` for the `json` format. This flag has
                        no effect on the `cyclonedx-json` or `cyclonedx-xml`
                        formats. (default: auto)
  --cache-dir CACHE_DIR
                        the directory to use as an HTTP cache for PyPI; uses
                        the `pip` HTTP cache by default (default: None)
  --progress-spinner {on,off}
                        display a progress spinner (default: on)
  --timeout TIMEOUT     set the socket timeout (default: 15)
  --path PATHS          restrict to the specified installation path for
                        auditing packages; this option can be used multiple
                        times (default: [])
  -v, --verbose         give more output; this setting overrides the
                        `PIP_AUDIT_LOGLEVEL` variable and is equivalent to
                        setting it to `debug` (default: False)
  --fix                 automatically upgrade dependencies with known
                        vulnerabilities (default: False)
  --require-hashes      require a hash to check each requirement against, for
                        repeatable audits; this option is implied when any
                        package in a requirements file has a `--hash` option.
                        (default: False)
  --index-url INDEX_URL
                        base URL of the Python Package Index; this should
                        point to a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the
                        simple repository API) (default:
                        https://pypi.org/simple)
  --extra-index-url EXTRA_INDEX_URLS
                        extra URLs of package indexes to use in addition to
                        `--index-url`; should follow the same rules as
                        `--index-url` (default: [])
```

### Exit codes

On completion, `pip-audit` will exit with a code indicating its status.

The current codes are:

* `0`: No known vulnerabilities were detected.
* `1`: One or more known vulnerabilities were found.

### Dry runs

`pip-audit` supports the `--dry-run` flag, which can be used to control whether
an audit (or fix) step is actually performed.

* On its own, `pip-audit --dry-run` skips the auditing step and prints
  the number of dependencies that *would have been* audited.
* In fix mode, `pip-audit --fix --dry-run` performs the auditing step and prints
  out the fix behavior (i.e., which dependencies would be upgraded or skipped)
  that *would have been performed*.

## Examples

Audit dependencies for the current Python environment:
```
$ pip-audit
No known vulnerabilities found
```

Audit dependencies for a given requirements file:
```
$ pip-audit -r ./requirements.txt
No known vulnerabilities found
```

Audit dependencies for a requirements file, excluding system packages:
```
$ pip-audit -r ./requirements.txt -l
No known vulnerabilities found
```

Audit dependencies when there are vulnerabilities present:
```
$ pip-audit

## Security Model

This section exists to describe the security assumptions you **can** and **must not**
make when using `pip-audit`.

TL;DR: **If you wouldn't `pip install` it, you should not `pip audit` it.**

`pip-audit` is a tool for auditing Python environments for packages with
*known vulnerabilities*. A "known vulnerability" is a publicly reported flaw in
a package that, if uncorrected, *might* allow a malicious actor to perform
unintended actions.

`pip-audit` **can** protect you against known vulnerabilities by telling
you when you have them, and how you should upgrade them. For example,
if you have `somepackage==1.2.3` in your environment, `pip-audit` **can** tell
you that it needs to be upgraded to `1.2.4`.

You **can** assume that `pip-audit` will make a best effort to *fully resolve*
all of your Python dependencies and *either* fully audit each *or* explicitly
state which ones it has skipped, as well as why it has skipped them.

`pip-audit` is **not** a static code analyzer. It analyzes dependency trees,
not code, and it **cannot** guarantee that arbitrary dependency resolutions
occur statically. To understand why this is, refer to Dustin Ingram's
[excellent post on dependency resolution in Python](https://dustingram.com/articles/2018/03/05/why-pypi-doesnt-know-dependencies/).

As such: you **must not** assume that `pip-audit` will **defend** you against
malicious packages. In particular, it is **incorrect** to treat
`pip-audit -r INPUT` as a "more secure" variant of `pip-audit`. For all intents
and purposes, `pip-audit -r INPUT` is functionally equivalent to
`pip install -r INPUT`, with a small amount of **non-security isolation** to
avoid conflicts with any of your local environments.
