    A wrapper around `EnvBuilder` that allows a custom package to be installed, and its resulting
    dependencies inspected.

    The `pip-audit` API uses this functionality internally to deduce what the dependencies are for a
    given source distribution since this can't be determined statically.

    The `create` method MUST be called before inspecting the `installed_packages` property otherwise
    a `VirtualEnvError` will be raised.

    The expected usage is:
    ```
    # Create a virtual environment and install the `pip-api` package.
    ve = VirtualEnv(["pip-api"])
    ve.create(".venv/")
